Let $G$ be a graph, and let $v$ and $w$ be vertices in $G$.
\vspace{3mm}

A walk from $v$ to $w$ is a finite alternating sequence of adjacent vertices and edges of $G$. Thus a walk has the form

$$
v_0 e_1 v_1 e_2 \cdots v_{n-1} e_n v_n
$$

where the $v$ 's represent vertices, the $e$ 's represent edges, $v_0=v, v_n=w$, and for each $i=1,2, \ldots n, v_{i-1}$ and $v_i$ are the endpoints of $e_i$. The trivial walk from $v$ to $v$ consists of the single vertex $v$.
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
  
\item A trail from $v$ to $w$ is a walk from $v$ to $w$ that does not contain a repeated edge.
\item A path from $v$ to $w$ is a trail that does not contain a repeated vertex.

\item A closed walk is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex.

\item A circuit is a closed walk that contains at least one edge and does not contain a repeated edge.

\item A simple circuit is a circuit that does not have any other repeated vertex except the first and last.

\ex{A Decision Tree}{
	During orientation week, a college administers a mathematics placement exam to all entering students. The exam consists of two parts, and placement recommendations are made as indicated by the tree shown below in figure 6.

We read the tree from left to right to decide what course should be recommended for a student who scored 9 on part I and 7 on part II.
\vspace{5mm}

Since the student socred 9 on part I, the score on part II is checked.
\vspace{4mm}

Since it is greater than 6, the student should be advised to take Math 110.

	\textbf{\underline{Defintion}}
	\vspace{3mm}

	There is a somewhat suprising relation between the number of vertices and the number of edges of a tree.
	\vspace{4mm}

	It turns out that if $n$ is a postive integer, then any tree with $n$ vertices (no matter what its shape) has $n-1$ edges.
	\vspace{4mm}

	Perhaps even more surprisingly, a partial converse to this fact is also true - namely, any connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges is a tree.
	\vspace{4mm}

	It follows from these facts that if even one new edge (but no new vertex) is added to a tree, the resulting graph must contain a circuit.
	\vspace{4mm}

	Also, from the fact that removing an edge from a circuit does not disconnect a graph, it can be shown that every connected graph has a subgraph that is a tree.
	\vspace{4mm}

	It follows that if $n$ is a positive integer, any graph with $n$ vertices and \textit{fewer} than $n-1$ edges is not connected.

	\textbf{\underline{Terminal Vertices}}
	\vspace{3mm}

	Let $T$ be a tree. If $T$ has at least two vertices, then a vertex of degree 1 in $T$ is called a \textbf{leaf} (or a \textbf{terminal vertex}), and a vertex of degree greater than 1 in $T$ is called an \textbf{internal vertex} (or a \textbf{branch vertex}). The unique vertex in a trivial tree is also called a \textbf{leaf} or \textbf{terminal vertex}.

\pf{Solution}

The terminal vertices are {\large{$$v_0, v_2, v_4, v_5, v_7, v_8$$}}
\vspace{3mm}

The internal vertices are {\large{$$v_6, v_1, v_3$$}}

\ex{}{
	A graph $G$ has ten vertices and twelve edges. Is it a tree?
}
\pf{Solution}

No, By definition of Theorem 8.2, any tree with ten vertices has nine edges, not twelve.
