Let $G$ be a graph, and let $v$ and $w$ be vertices in $G$.
\vspace{3mm}

A walk from $v$ to $w$ is a finite alternating sequence of adjacent vertices and edges of $G$. Thus a walk has the form

$$
v_0 e_1 v_1 e_2 \cdots v_{n-1} e_n v_n
$$

where the $v$ 's represent vertices, the $e$ 's represent edges, $v_0=v, v_n=w$, and for each $i=1,2, \ldots n, v_{i-1}$ and $v_i$ are the endpoints of $e_i$. The trivial walk from $v$ to $v$ consists of the single vertex $v$.
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
  
\item A trail from $v$ to $w$ is a walk from $v$ to $w$ that does not contain a repeated edge.
\item A path from $v$ to $w$ is a trail that does not contain a repeated vertex.

\item A closed walk is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex.

\item A circuit is a closed walk that contains at least one edge and does not contain a repeated edge.

\item A simple circuit is a circuit that does not have any other repeated vertex except the first and last.

	\textbf{\underline{Defintion}}
	\vspace{3mm}

	There is a somewhat suprising relation between the number of vertices and the number of edges of a tree.
	\vspace{4mm}

	It turns out that if $n$ is a postive integer, then any tree with $n$ vertices (no matter what its shape) has $n-1$ edges.
	\vspace{4mm}

	Perhaps even more surprisingly, a partial converse to this fact is also true - namely, any connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges is a tree.
	\vspace{4mm}

	It follows from these facts that if even one new edge (but no new vertex) is added to a tree, the resulting graph must contain a circuit.
	\vspace{4mm}

	Also, from the fact that removing an edge from a circuit does not disconnect a graph, it can be shown that every connected graph has a subgraph that is a tree.
	\vspace{4mm}

	It follows that if $n$ is a positive integer, any graph with $n$ vertices and \textit{fewer} than $n-1$ edges is not connected.

\thmcon{

	\vspace{3mm}

	In mathematics, a rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been distinguished from the others and is designed the \textit{root}. Given any other vertex $v$ in the tree, there is a unique path from the root to $v$.
	\vspace{5mm}

	The number of edges in such a path is called the level of $v$, and the \textit{height} of the tree is the length of the longest such path. It is traditional in drawing rooted trees to place the root at the top and show the branches descending from it.
	\bigbreak \noindent
	A \textbf{rooted tree} is a tree in which there is one vertex that is distinguished from the others and is called the \textbf{root}.
	\vspace{2mm}

	The \textbf{level} of a vertex is the number of edges along the unique path between it and the root. 
	\vspace{2.5mm}

	The \textbf{height} of a rooted tree is the maximum level of any vertex of the tree. Given the root or any internal vertex $v$ of a rooted tree, the \textbf{children} of $v$ are all those vertices that are adjacent to $v$ and are one level farther away from the root than $v$. 
	\vspace{3mm}

	If $w$ is a child of $v$, then $v$ is called the \textbf{parent} of $w$, and two distinct vertices that are both children of the same parent are called \textbf{siblings}. Given two distinct vertices $v$ and $w$, if $v$ lies on the unique path between $w$ and the root, then $v$ is an \textbf{ancestor} of $w$ and $w$ is a \textbf{descendant} of $v$.

	A \textbf{binary tree} is a rooted tree in which every parent has at most two children.

	Each child in a binary tree is designated either a \textbf{left child} or a \textbf{right child} (but not both), and every parent has at most one left child and one right child.

	A \textbf{full binary tree} is a binary tree in which each parent has exactly two children.
	\vspace{3mm}

	Given any parent $v$ in a binary tree $T$, if $v$ has a left child, then the \textbf{left subtree} of $v$ is the binary tree whose root is the left child of $v$, whose vertices consist of the left child of $v$ and all its descendants, and whose edges consist of all those edges of $T$ that connect the vertices of the left subtree. The \textbf{right subtree} of $v$ is defined analogously.

An interesting theorem about binary trees says that if you know the number of internal vertices of a full binary tree, then you can calculate both the total number of vertices and the number of leaves, and conversely. More specifically, a full binary tree with $k$ internal vertices has a total of $2 k+1$ vertices of which $k+1$ are leaves.

\thmcon{
	\textbf{\underline{Defintion}}
	\vspace{3mm}

	A binary search tree is a kind of binary tree in which data records, such as customer information, can be stored, searched, and processed very efficiently. To place records into a binary search tree, it must be possible to arrange them in a total order.
	\vspace{4mm}

	In case they do not have a natural total order of their own, an element of a totally ordered set, such as a number or a word and called a \textbf{key}, may be added to each record. The keys are inserted into the vertices of the tree and provide access to the records to which they are attached.
	\vspace{5mm}

	Once it is built, a binary search tree has the following property: 
	\vspace{2mm}

	for every internal vertex $v$, all the keys in the \textbf{left subtree} of $v$ are \textbf{less} than the key in $v$, and all the keys in the \textbf{right subtree} of $v$ are \textbf{greater} than the key in $v$.

For example, check that the following is a binary search tree for the set of records with the following keys: $$15,10,19,25,12,4$$

  To build a binary search tree, start by making a root and insert a key into it.
  \vspace{5mm}

\noindent To add a new key, compare it to the key at the root. If the new key is less than the key at the root, give the root a left child and insert the new key into it.
\vspace{4mm}

\noindent If the key is greater than the key at the root, give the root a right child and insert the new key into it.
\vspace{4mm}

\noindent So to add a key at a subsequent stage, work down the tree to find a place to put the new key, starting at the root and either moving left or right depending on whether the new key is less or greater than the key at the vertex to which it is currently being compared.t
